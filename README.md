# CS50xPortfolio
I’m building a public portfolio that proves I learn quickly, ship reliable projects with ethics and impact. This repo documents my Week 0 CS50 Dropper (Packet Defender) prototype, the design choices I made, and the lessons I learned—so mentors, reviewers, and future employers can follow my progress, give focused feedback, and verify my growth.
